# Calendar Calculator

![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aaron-Benson/calendar-calculator/master/demo.PNG)

This is a simple program showing how my Month object can be used to calculate future months by gathering inputs about the year and new year weekday for that year. Month provides a very simple interface for interaction and it is efficient. For more information about how Month works, consult the Month header file for descriptions about public and private members.

Programmed in C++.

## Installation 

1. Clone the repository locally.
